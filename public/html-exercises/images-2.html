    This is the most "decent" childhood picture that I have so far. I started school when I was three years old and played on the streets. 
    My daily afternoon routine would include me taking a nap, wake up to play <em>patintero, luksong baka, taguan, bangsak</em> and go home early to catch up with my favorite anime series.
    I played with Tamiya, Matchbox, Beyblade, Gundam, Pogs and Texts instead of Barbie or bratz

    And this is me during my high school graduation, two years ago. Since I've been studying at the same school (UPIS) since I was kinder until I was high school,
    it feels like my whole stay there was too memorable and epic. I just have to include my elementary memories. My friends and I used to sneak out the campus
    just to go to CASAA or McDo Katipunan. We would vandalize parts of our old HS campus now turned into UP Town Center and daringly cross Katipunan Ave. without using the over pass.

    This was taken last June 2, 2015 at Tagaytay, my "last" attempt to have a taste of summer (AKA two-week break before mid year starts). I am on my way
    to being a junior BACA student and the current Public Relations Officer of The Rhetoricians: The UPLB Speech Communication Organization. I have a social life, I think.
    (Which includes facing my laptop all day long, watching youtube videos, tv series and blogging.) and I have my camera. I am an impulsive buyer whenever I have money. I recently bought an Instax Mini 8 because it was fancy.

    Someday, I plan to be a diplomat. I really love talking and negotiating with people and I guess that is what pushed me into this field. I also want to travel outside the country, go to places and meet people. This is probably one job that I would like to have in the future.
