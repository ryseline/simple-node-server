    <p><strong>Movies:</strong></p>
    <p>The latest movie that I saw in the big screen was <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0369610/">Jurassic World</a> which would probably count as my third favorite movie (as of the moment). I loved the Jurassic Park Series ever since John Hammond started the damned park and Dr. Allan Grant started running away from the T-rex.</p>

    <p>My second all time favorite movie is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0356470/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">A Cinderella Story</a>. Being a chick-flick and rom-com fan, I will never get tired of watching the fairy tale I love with a modern twist. Of course, my very first prince charming, Austin set the standard of my dream guys in life</p>
    <blockquote><em>"Never let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game."</em></blockquote>
    <p>And my all time favorite movie is of course, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0240890/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">Serendipity</a>. The movie made me believe that all thing that have happened to me and all that will happen are not just mere accidents or coincedents, everything is related and at some point in time, all those relations will be revealed.</p>

    <p><strong>Music</strong></p>
    <p>My current favorite is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7bie5qQuIE&list=RDZ7bie5qQuIE">Never Seen Anything Quite Like You</a> by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCafVZzwtU8XUWbXGs4LYtdg">The Script</a>. After seeing them perform it live in MOA Arena last April 17,2015, I loved it even more. </p>
    <blockquote><em>"Sometimes words just ain't enough this love that's more than love"</em></blockquote>
    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCANLZYMidaCbLQFWXBC95Jg">Taylor Swift's</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptSjNWnzpjg">Fearless</a> is my second favorite song. Even if I haven't seen her perform it live, I can relate to the lyrics. I just had to have this in my favorite song list because I'm a Swiftie</p>
    <blockquote><em>"And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress, fearless"</em></blockquote>
    <p>Finally, my all time favorite song of all is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0SocbXEal8">At the Beginning</a> by Richard Marx and Donna Lewis. Besides it being the theme song of my favorite animated movie, Anastasia, I also love the lyrics of the song</p>
    <blockquote><em>"No one told me, that I was going to find you, unexpected, what you did to my heart."</em></blockquote>
