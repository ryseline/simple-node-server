				<p>The father of the World Wide Web is none other than Tim Berners-Lee. In 1989, while was in CERN, Oxford graduate Berners-Lee inveted the Web. It was in 1990 that we wrote the first web client and server. He became the World Wide Web Consortium director when it was founded in 1994. The organization was formed to further develop the function and utilities of the web. The first website was built in CERN in December 1990. There were about 26 sites already up around 1992. </p>
				<p>On April 30, 1993, CERN declared that the World Wide Web can already be accessed to everyone with no charges.</p>
				<p>The web was not all the time colorful and pleasing to the eyes. AOL and Compuserve started to develop Graphical User Interface to fix the layout and color of the Web. After some time, the Hypertext Markup Language or the standard interface of the Web was developed. It allowed pages to display different fonts, sizes and colors.</p>
				<p>Another succesful invention on the Web was Ted Nelson's concept of  hyperlinks which, by just clicking a word on a page, would tranfer you to another page.</p>
				<p>The URL or the Uniform Resource Locator was also created so that each site would have a unique address in the Web.</p>
				<p>It was in 1993 that the first browser became available. However, Mosaic was slow and didn't function very well. In 1994, Marc Anderseen founded Netscape Corporation.</p>
				<p>Amazon, a popular shopping site, was first conceptualized in 1994.</p>
				<p>By 1998, over 750,000 websites could already be accessed by users of the Web.</p>
				<p>The rest, as they say, is history.</p>
