"In the Beginning, ARPA created the ARPANET.
And the ARPANET was without form and void.

And darkness was upon the deep.

And the spirit of ARPA moved upon the face of the network and ARPA said, 'Let there be a protocol,' and there was a protocol. And ARPA saw that it was good.

And ARPA said, 'Let there be more protocols,' and it was so. And ARPA saw that it was good.

And ARPA said, 'Let there be more networks,' and it was so."

         <p>In 1962, Dr. Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider, was one of the first scientist to come up with the idea of creating an "Intergalactic Computer Network". It aims to connect everyone who has access to a computer and allows them to retrieve data and run programs anytime they want and anywhere they are. With this vision in mind, Dr. Licklider eventually became the research head of one of the greatest inventions mankind has known - the Internet. It was in 1963, that Dr. Licklider became the director of the U.S. Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) </p>
         <p>Leonard Kleinrock from MIT published a paper about packet switching theory. Packet switching happens when data or information is broken down to smaller parts to be sent from one user to another. This led to replacing circuit switching. </p>
         <p>The first ever computer network to be built was from the TX-2 Computer in Massachusetts to the Q-32 computer in California. This project was headed by Thomas Merill and Lawrence Roberts. This proved Kleinrock's theory about packet switching was true as it was proven that circuit switching was not enough to transfer and receive programs and data. </p>
         <p>Roberts then went to DARPA to push through his plans with ARPANET. In a conference he attended, Donald Davies and Roger Scantlebury of National Physical Laboratory also had the same concept of packet networks. Paul Baran from RAND had also researched on packet switching networks for the military. None of the researchers knew about each other's work but all of them have the same concept that led to the creation of the Internet.</p>
